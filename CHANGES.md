# AI Companion VRM Avatar Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the changes made to implement and fix the 3D VRM avatar functionality in the AI Companion extension.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. THREE.js Loading Issues
- Fixed the loading sequence to ensure THREE.js is properly loaded before attempting to use it
- Added event-based detection for when the VRM bundle is fully loaded
- Implemented retry mechanisms with timeouts to handle asynchronous loading
- Added verification steps to confirm required components (THREE, GLTFLoader, VRMLoaderPlugin) are available

### 2. VRM Model Storage and Retrieval
- Improved the model storage mechanism to properly save VRM models to Chrome storage
- Enhanced the model retrieval process to correctly find and load selected models
- Added better fallback mechanisms when models aren't found or can't be loaded
- Fixed URL handling for both sample models and user-uploaded models

### 3. UI Improvements
- Fixed the "Load Model" button functionality to properly handle both sample and local models
- Enhanced the file upload process with better error handling and status updates
- Ensured the model selection persists between sessions
- Added synchronization between different UI elements (dropdowns, toggles)

### 4. Error Handling
- Added comprehensive error handling throughout the VRM loading process
- Implemented fallback mechanisms when WebGL rendering fails
- Added proper cleanup for VRM resources to prevent memory leaks
- Improved error messages and status updates to provide better user feedback

## File Changes

### 1. `popup.js`
- Fixed `handleVRMUpload()` method to properly process uploaded VRM files
- Enhanced `handleSuccessfulVRMLoad()` to ensure model data is properly stored
- Added missing `saveVRMModels()` method to persist models to storage
- Updated `updateVRMModelsList()` to correctly display and select models
- Fixed `useSampleVRMModel()` to properly handle the sample model

### 2. `content.js`
- Updated the `updateVRMModel` message handler to properly store model data
- Enhanced `createVRMAvatar()` to correctly retrieve and use model data from storage
- Improved `loadThreeJsLibraries()` with better loading and verification
- Added proper cleanup in the `dispose()` method to prevent memory leaks

### 3. `popup-vrm-viewer.js`
- Enhanced initialization process to wait for THREE.js to be available
- Added event listeners for the VRM bundle loaded event
- Implemented fallback mechanisms with timeouts

### 4. `manifest.json`
- Updated content scripts to include the VRM bundle before other scripts

## Testing
The implementation has been tested with:
- Sample VRM models from the extension
- User-uploaded VRM models
- Different browser sessions and page refreshes to verify persistence

## Known Limitations
- Large VRM files may take longer to load and might cause performance issues
- Some VRM models might not render correctly depending on their format version
- WebGL support is required for 3D rendering
